It focuses on a study which looks at evidence-based interventions that were developed and tested with primarily White, mid-upper class, monolingual English-speaking populations, to see if they align well with diverse cultural values. This was a mixed methods study looking at White and Latin families. It was found that it is important to Latin parents that they are involved in the treatment process. She also emphasized the importance placed on social connection for families to navigate autism, especially in Latin families. There is a strong need for Spanish-speaking clinicians to be able to provide support to these families who may be more comfortable conversing about sensitive subjects in their primary language.
